   add this file to follow global changes and tags
   Add just before going to svn version on crppsvn
   It has interpos.f version for hal and linux64 bits working (with mxfree, etc)

   do after ci of this file:
   cvs tag interpos_2_0

May 5 2009:
    cvs2svn
    using link to interpos_linux64bits.f, compiled and tested on gateway with pgf90
    tag interpos_2_1 with svn:
    svn cp file:///home/osauter/SVNREPOS_singles/interpos/trunk file:///home/osauter/SVNREPOS_singles/interpos/tags/interpos_2_1

August 14
    To get copy on other computers like lac or hal:
    svn co svn+ssh://osauter@crpppc98.epfl.ch/home/osauter/SVNREPOS_singles/interpos/trunk interpos

August 18
     tag 2_2: (see README in f90interpos_release for further comments)

     svn cp file:///home/osauter/SVNREPOS_singles/interpos/trunk file:///home/osauter/SVNREPOS_singles/interpos/tags/interpos_2_2 -m"tag version 2_2 with ifort  -O3 -r8 -automatic -xT -parallel prec_rkind.f90 interpos.f90 cbsplgen0.f90 cbsplgenp0.f90 cbsplgen.f90 cbsplgenp.f90 cbfitbnd.f90 splibnd.f90 cbfitper.f90 spliper.f90 spgbtrf_s.f cbspltest_3.f90 OK in f90 and interpostest case 3 ok as well"

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Start combining non-periodic and periodic boundary conditions using nbcleft=-1 or -2 for periodic case into one cbsplgen routine for both matlab and f90
     Will become version 3_0


Sept 16 2009
     f90 working version with periodic boundary conditions in matlab part as well
     cp to tags/interpos_3_0 before starting adding integrated results

Sept 25 2009
     f90 working version in matlab dir with integrated results for bounded conditions as well
     changed way to find intervals to be faster
     Start making a full test case in test directory, but 1st tag this version as interpos_3_1

Sept 27 2009
     f90 versions for all files but top file identical for matlab or f90 version. Test in ./test dir for f90 and matlab working 
     including periodic boundary conditions, including use of library.
     Should now create main directory with library files and makefile, and have only top files i f90 or matlab dir.
     Before, do a tag to 4_0 (new version since has integral in output as well)
     svn cp file:///home/osauter/SVNREPOS_singles/interpos/trunk file:///home/osauter/SVNREPOS_singles/interpos/tags/interpos_4_0 -m"1st version with integral in output for both matlab and f90 versions"

     Made Makefile with all options ok to make interpos for matlab, to make lib or to make f90_test

     tags this version 4_1 then dump and copy to top crppsvn repository

October 16 2009
     Version quite general for interpos call with module and overload. Ready for 1st release
     Tags interpos_5_0

October 18 2009
     Debugged version now working with pgf90 as well and add f90 test interpostest_profile.f90
     Tags interpos_5_1
     svn cp -m"for tag interpos_5_1" http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/osauter/interpos/trunk http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/osauter/interpos/tags/interpos_5_1

October 20 2009
      Changed tension to be only intent(in), otherwise one cannot give: tension=1._rkind as argument with no obvious error message. So safer like this
      svn cp -m"for tag interpos_5_2 tension only intent(in)" http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/osauter/interpos/trunk http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/osauter/interpos/tags/interpos_5_2

Nov 7 2009
     Rm mex file and other bin from svn. Clean some other stuff.
     Tag to version 5_3:
     svn cp -m"for tag interpos_5_3 tested with/without lapack in pi/g95 subdir" http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/osauter/interpos/trunk http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/osauter/interpos/tags/interpos_5_3

Nov17 2009
     Changed CRPP interpos matlab to present version. Found a bug when xout scalar and interpolation linear or quadr, should be taken into account.
     interpos_matlab_top.f90 was modified and new version active since Nov 20 afternoon.
     Starting to add eqdsk2D example in f90, and bndfit with periodic bc, need sorting as well for rho(theta)

Jan 20 2010
     Added interpostest_2Deqdsk.f90 and indexx.f90 (sorting) for full eqdsk transform test including BNDFIT stuff
     Moved repository from http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/osauter/interpos to http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos
     Need to do: svn switch --relocate http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/osauter http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos
     But then moved tags, branches, trunk up one directory and rm interpos/interpos. So need to redo check-out
     Tag this version: svn cp -m"for tag interpos_5_4, has full f90 for eqdsk with BNDFIT included and new top interpos svn" http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/trunk http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/tags/interpos_5_4

March 2 2010
     for matlab mex part: Check if length of kopt, xin and yin are ok and check if any NaNs are present with isnan from f90
     Tag  interpos_5_5
     Tag  interpos_5_5b (added check of length 0 for xin (needs to check each row and col))

March 17 2010
      for matlab 7.10 compatibility change mxCreateFull to mxCreateDoubleMatrix
      add deallocate of xout, yout, etc
      Tag interpos_5_6

March 22 2010
      Note that version on gateway has minval for default tension everywhere but not present version. Check and modify:
      make interposg95 (to remake lib)
      make interpostest_f90_eqdsk (to make interpostest_f90_eqdsk)
      cd ../matlab/example (to have file eqdsksigns.31837t1.0000)
      ../../interpos_libs/interpostest_f90_eqdsk > aaa_eqdsk.m
      matlab -nodesktop
      >> aaa_eqdsk
      >> run ../../f90interpos_release/example/aaaplot_eqdsk.m (to plot data read with aaa_eqdsk)

      It shows that had to use now mean(dx) otherwise there is a drho very small and the effective default tensio is too small.
      Add comments into interpos_module.f90

      tag interpos_5_7
      svn cp -m"for tag interpos_5_7 clarify default tension is mean(dx)" http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/trunk http://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/tags/interpos_5_7

March 31 2010
      rm "return" if NaNs in xin or yin, so it returns NaNs
      Clean-up interpostest3 and comments in interpos_module, cleanup intent(in) or out
      tag interpos_5_8

April/June 2010
      Added 32bits version, tested and works => tag version 5_9
      Remove bug using ybc(3) or more when only ybc(1:2) given => tag version 5_10

Sept 2011
      Automatic choice of linear or quadratic interpolation if less than 4 points are given
      Some additional checks if inputs have 0 length
      tag interpos_5_11
      svn cp -m"for tag interpos_5_11 some minor bugs corrected and checks better for validity of inputs" https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/trunk https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/tags/interpos_5_11

Nov 2011
      Add interface for intlinear and intquadratic in matlab mex file (required for new g95 version)

Dec 2011
      Add checks if multiple x in inputs, avoid these input points automatically. Might alter expected xout
      Add interpos_source.f90 target in make file to have direct link with CHEASE or any other standalone codes
      Since changed interface from
   SUBROUTINE interpos_defxscal(X,Y,N,tension,xscal,yscal,yscalp,yscalpp,yscalint,nbcscal,ybcscal,sigma,option,info)
      to
   SUBROUTINE interpos_defxscal(X,Y,N,xscal,tension,yscal,yscalp,yscalpp,yscalint,nbcscal,ybcscal,sigma,option,info)
      at revision 173 to 174, should have changed main tag number. Do it now:
      tag interpos_6_0
      svn cp -m"for tag interpos_6_0 added many diff checks and has defxscal arguments inverted since rev 174" https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/trunk https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/tags/interpos_6_0

Dec 13,2011
      Add tau(x) option with cubic spline also to periodic boundary conditions
      tag interpos_6_1
      svn cp -m"Add tau(x) option with cubic spline also to periodic boundary conditions" https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/trunk https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/tags/interpos_6_1

April 18, 2012
      Added interfaces in above chanegs. Now removed bug in intquadratic, forgetting to define ALFA parameter. Set to 1.0
      tag interpos_6_2
      svn cp -m"Ready for tag interpos_6_2, rm bug in intquadratic.f90 and related files" https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/trunk https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/tags/interpos_6_2

Jan 30, 2013
      bug in calling periodic with yin_neff fixed, was problem if more than last point was removed
      tag interpos_6_3
      svn cp -m"tag interpos_6_3, rm bug calling periodic with yin_neff" https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/trunk https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/tags/interpos_6_3

July 2013
      rm -parallel in ifort compilation and checked in above yin_eff bug as well. Tag 6_4
      svn cp -m"tag interpos_6_4, rm bug calling periodic with yin_neff and rm -parallel in ifort library for fc2k" https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/trunk https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/tags/interpos_6_4

August 2013
      Add check if pxin is ascending order in cbsplgnp as well. Found problems for matlab mex file which seems to be due to "intent" statements and large arrays. So tag version just before and just after removing all intent's
     svn cp -m"tag interpos_6_5,  Add check if pxin is ascending order in cbsplgnp as well and just before removing all intent statements which will lead to tag 7_1" https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/trunk https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/tags/interpos_6_5 

     Removed all intent statements, compiled on lac with default (g95) and checked with write_pgyro and interpostest_time which have long arrays (on lac5) and interpostest in example. All are fine

March 2014
     Checked on AUG with gfortran, minor fixes, checked make interpostest_f90_eqdsk as well (should change example interpostest to have only calls to interpos). Ready for tag 7.2
     svn cp -m"tag interpos_7_2,  minor fixes checked with gfortran at IPP" https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/trunk https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/tags/interpos_7_2

October 2014
     Bug in old function FCDCD... found. This is used for extrapolation. 
     Debugged also options for extrapolation, there were some inconsistencies with manual
     Version tagged 8.1 (since major bug fixed)
     svn cp -m"tag interpos_8_1,  "bug fixed for extrapolation in particular FCDCD, also in CHEASE" https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/trunk https://crppsvn.epfl.ch/repos/interpos/tags/interpos_8_1

November 2014
     Now only gfortran on gateway (no pgf95, pgf90), so modify Make_all_lib and Makefile and add gfortran_libs directory
     Version tagged 8.2
